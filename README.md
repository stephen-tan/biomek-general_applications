# Biomek General Applications 

## Purpose
The motivation behind creating general applications methods for the Beckman Coulter Biomek liquid handlers was to allow researchers to generate simple automated methods without any additional method development.

For example, say a user wanted to transfer a specified volume from one microplate into another.. Previously, said user would have to work with another engineer to develop the method, and if any parameters such as transfer volume needed to be changed, a new method would have to be saved (as).

With the General Applications Methods, the user can generate multiple variations of the same method _without_ having to save at all. An additional option allows the user to download their parameters and re-upload them to auto-fill the method form if so desired.
